I'm a third year undergraduate from [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://me.dlut.edu.cn), [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn). My research interset includes surrogate modelling, digital twins.

I am currently enrolled in a combined undergraduate-phD program, and I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Xueguan Song](https://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/sxg/zh_CN/index.htm).
